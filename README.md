## A mass in the brain thought to be brain cancer at the 20 week anatomy scan, Nicolette was born with Ohtahara Syndrome and Cortical Dysplasia. Half of the babies born with this pass by 2 years of age, and Nicolette was no different, and close to death on several occasions, half her brain was removed and donated to science at age 6 months.

## Nicolette and my wife are epileptics, and they have both had brain surgeries. I've also watched, helplessly, as other parents and their children suffer from a debilitating brain disorder, begging doctors to tell them what's happening to their children. But neurologists can only experiment with drug cocktails or surgeries because the underlying mechanisms that govern epilepsy is far from understood, the understanding of which is thought to lie on the frontiers of unsolved mathematical equations in the field of nonlinear dynamics. 

## These experiences drove me to learn how to model such complicated processes via mathematics, python, and data science. 

## Today, as a data scientist, husband, and father, my personal and professional interests are designing AI models to understand these terrible disorders and help fins answers for those, who like me, watch their wife and youngest daughter have seizures every day.

## Data, it's analysis, and it's potential for mankind through AI, are my passion, whether it's using it for epilepsy, product analysis, sales forecasting or  nature, the answer is found in the numerical patterns in the data, or through its mathematical transformations.
