Hello, I'm a data scientist, husband, and father, driven by personal experiences to make impactful contributions in the field of healthcare, particularly in understanding and mitigating brain disorders like epilepsy.

My journey began in a deeply personal context. My wife and youngest daughter, Nicolette, both suffer from epilepsy, with Nicolette having been diagnosed with Ohtahara Syndrome and Cortical Dysplasia at birth. Nicolette underwent a brain surgery at just six months old, half of her brain was donated to science. Watching their battles with seizures every day, and the suffering of many others who experience similar conditions, led me to a profound realization: we need better understanding of these disorders.

To this end, I have dedicated myself to using the tools and methods of data science to unlock insights about these debilitating conditions. I believe that the answers lie at the intersection of advanced mathematical models in nonlinear dynamics and machine learning algorithms. I'm particularly interested in predictive modeling, personalized medicine, drug efficacy analysis, and brain mapping using AI.

Moreover, I'm excited about leveraging AI to make sense of the complex patterns hidden in vast amounts of health data, and about the potential of AI to provide more personalized, effective treatment strategies.

As a data scientist, I understand the immense value of data - its analysis, its patterns, and its potential to benefit humanity through AI. Whether it's deploying these skills to understand epilepsy, to drive product analysis, to forecast sales, or to unlock the secrets of nature, I'm passionate about extracting truth and insight from data.

Collaboration is key in this journey, and I look forward to working with other data scientists, neurologists, geneticists, and bioinformaticians. I invite you to explore my projects, offer insights, and join me in this mission to use data science for a greater cause.
